# quartz-transformer-mmlabc

A Quartz transformer plugin that converts MML (Music Macro Language) and chord progression notation code blocks into interactive sheet music using abcjs.

Note: This document is a placeholder, hastily generated by an LLM. It will be refined in the future.

## Features

- 🎵 Converts `mml` code blocks to ABC notation and renders them with abcjs
- 🎸 Converts `chord` code blocks to MML, then to ABC notation, and renders them with abcjs
- 🎼 Supports `abc` notation code blocks for troubleshooting or direct use
- 🎨 Automatically renders sheet music as SVG (displays musical staves)
- 🎧 Click to Play Music - You can play music by clicking on the rendered sheet music
- ⚡ Lightweight and standalone npm module
- 🔧 TypeScript support

## Installation

Since this package is not published on npm, please install it directly from GitHub:

```bash
npm install github:cat2151/quartz-transformer-mmlabc
```

Or if you use yarn:

```bash
yarn add github:cat2151/quartz-transformer-mmlabc
```

## Build

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** After installation, you need to build the plugin to generate the `dist` directory:

```bash
cd node_modules/quartz-transformer-mmlabc
npm run build
```

Reasons why this step is necessary:
- The plugin is installed directly from GitHub (not from npm)
- The `dist` directory containing compiled JavaScript is not included in the repository
- The build process compiles TypeScript source files into the necessary JavaScript files

Skipping this step will result in an error when running Quartz, as the plugin's entry point (`dist/index.js`) will not exist.

## Usage

### Using in Quartz Configuration

Add the transformer to `quartz.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { QuartzConfig } from "./quartz/cfg"
import * as Plugin from "./quartz/plugins"
import { MMLABCTransformer } from "quartz-transformer-mmlabc"

const config: QuartzConfig = {
  configuration: {
    // ... site configuration
  },
  plugins: {
    transformers: [
      Plugin.FrontMatter(),
      Plugin.CreatedModifiedDate({ priority: ["frontmatter", "filesystem"] }),
      // Add MMLABC transformer
      MMLABCTransformer(),
      // ... other transformers
    ],
    filters: [Plugin.RemoveDrafts()],
    emitters: [
      Plugin.AliasRedirects(),
      Plugin.ComponentResources(),
      Plugin.ContentPage(),
      // ... other emitters
    ],
  },
}

export default config
```

**Important Points:**
- Import `QuartzConfig` and built-in plugins from Quartz's internal paths
- This plugin is imported by its npm package name
- Add it to the `transformers` array along with other transformers
- The order usually doesn't matter unless there are dependencies between plugins

### Using in Markdown Files

#### MML Notation

````markdown
```mml
t120 l4 cdefgab>c
```
````

#### Chord Progression Notation

````markdown
```chord
C Dm7 G7 C
```
````

#### ABC Notation (Direct Specification)

````markdown
```abc
X:1
T:Simple Scale
M:4/4
L:1/4
K:C
C D E F|G A B c|
```
````

This is useful for troubleshooting or when you want to write ABC notation directly.

## Options

The plugin accepts optional configurations:

```typescript
MMLABCTransformer({
  enableMML: true,    // Enable MML block conversion (default: true)
  enableChord: true,  // Enable chord progression block conversion (default: true)
  enableABC: true,    // Enable ABC block conversion (default: true)
})
```

## How it Works

1.  During the Quartz build process, the plugin detects code blocks with `mml`, `chord`, or `abc` language tags
2.  It replaces these code blocks with HTML div elements containing the source notation as data attributes
3.  In the browser:
    -   abcjs and mml2abc are loaded from a CDN
    -   For MML blocks: mml2abc is used to convert MML to ABC notation
    -   For chord progression blocks: chord2mml is used to convert the chord progression to MML, and then to ABC notation
    -   For ABC blocks: the notation is used directly without conversion
    -   abcjs is used to render the ABC notation as interactive SVG
    -   An audio synthesizer is initialized to support music playback
    -   A click event handler is added to allow playing music by clicking on the sheet music

## Current Status

### Implemented Features
- ✅ Detection and conversion of MML blocks
- ✅ Detection and conversion of chord progression blocks
- ✅ Detection and direct rendering of ABC blocks (useful for troubleshooting)
- ✅ Rendering of ABC notation using abcjs (displaying musical staves)
- ✅ Pinning CDN dependencies to specific commit hashes
- ✅ Interactive audio playback (click the sheet music to play the piece from the beginning)
  - Uses abcjs synth API and Web Audio API
  - Visual feedback during playback (background color change and status display)
  - Automatic stop upon playback completion
  - Clicking again stops playback

## Notes

- Conversion to HTML occurs during Quartz's build process
- Actual sheet music conversion and rendering happen in the browser
- MML to ABC conversion uses mml2abc loaded from a CDN (pinned to commit `c32f3f3`)
- Rendering uses abcjs loaded from a CDN
- Libraries are loaded dynamically to avoid bundling issues

## Testing

The plugin includes a comprehensive automated test suite using Vitest:

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite includes:
- Unit tests for AST transformation logic
- Tests for HTML escaping (newlines, tabs, special characters)
- Tests for plugin options and configuration
- Handling of edge cases
- Validation of external resources

For manual testing, please use the included `demo.html` file.

**Note**: When a Coding Agent runs tests on a Linux Runner, musical staves will not be displayed due to CDN blocking. If you wish to confirm the display of musical staves, please test on a physical machine (local environment).
