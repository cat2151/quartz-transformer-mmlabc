## Status
- Core features implemented.
- Currently dogfooding.
- Subject to breaking changes.

## Explained in 3 Lines
- In Obsidian, you can render and play sheet music by writing chord progressions in a code block: https://github.com/cat2151/obsidian-plugin-mmlabc
- To achieve the same functionality in Quartz, a new transformer plugin has been developed.
- Similar to the Obsidian version, MML (Music Macro Language) and ABC Notation are also supported.

## Features

- 🎵 Converts `mml` code blocks to ABC Notation and renders them with abcjs.
- 🎸 Converts `chord` code blocks to MML, then to ABC Notation, and renders them with abcjs.
- 🎼 Supports `abc` notation code blocks for troubleshooting.
- 🎨 Displays sheet music as SVG.
- 🎧 Click to play music - Click on the rendered score to play the music.
- ⌨️ Keyboard accessibility supported (play with Enter or Space key).

## Installation

Execute the following in your Quartz installation directory:

```powershell
npm install github:cat2151/quartz-transformer-mmlabc; pushd node_modules/quartz-transformer-mmlabc; npm run build; popd
```

Reason for this step:
- The plugin is installed directly from GitHub (not from npm).
- The `dist` directory, which contains the compiled JavaScript, is not included in the repository.
- Skipping this step will result in an error during Quartz execution because the plugin's entry point (`dist/index.js`) will be missing.

Additionally, add the following *before* `Build Quartz` in `.github\workflows\deploy.yml`:
```yml
      - name: Build quartz-transformer-mmlabc
        run: npm run build
        working-directory: node_modules/quartz-transformer-mmlabc
```
Reason for this step:
- Without this step, during deployment with GitHub Actions, the plugin's entry point (`dist/index.js`) will not exist, causing an error during `Build Quartz`.

### How to Update the Plugin (Two Options)

**Important**: This plugin is currently Work In Progress and is subject to frequent breaking changes (non-stable). You have two options for updating the plugin:

#### Option 1: Always use the latest version on deployment (Recommended for development)

If you want to use the latest version of the plugin with every deployment, add the following steps to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yml
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Update quartz-transformer-mmlabc to latest
        run: npm update quartz-transformer-mmlabc
      - name: Build quartz-transformer-mmlabc
        run: npm run build
        working-directory: node_modules/quartz-transformer-mmlabc
```

**Pros**:
- Always applies the latest features and bug fixes.
- Critical bug fixes are applied immediately.

**Cons**:
- Breaking changes may be applied immediately.
- Slightly increases build time.

#### Option 2: Rely on weekly updates via Dependabot

If Dependabot is configured, it will automatically create weekly PRs for plugin updates. This method allows you to review the updates before merging.

Example `.github/dependabot.yml`:
```yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
```

**Pros**:
- Allows you to review updates before merging.
- Enables operation with a stable version.

**Cons**:
- Plugin updates may be delayed by up to one week.
- Critical bug fixes may also require waiting up to one week.

## Usage

### Using in Quartz Configuration

Add the transformer to `quartz.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { QuartzConfig } from "./quartz/cfg"
import * as Plugin from "./quartz/plugins"
import { MMLABCTransformer } from "quartz-transformer-mmlabc"

const config: QuartzConfig = {
  configuration: {
    // ... site configuration
  },
  plugins: {
    transformers: [
      Plugin.FrontMatter(),
      Plugin.CreatedModifiedDate({ priority: ["frontmatter", "filesystem"] }),
      // Add the MMLABC transformer
      MMLABCTransformer(),
      // ... other transformers
    ],
    filters: [Plugin.RemoveDrafts()],
    emitters: [
      Plugin.AliasRedirects(),
      Plugin.ComponentResources(),
      Plugin.ContentPage(),
      // ... other emitters
    ],
  },
}

export default config
```

**Key points:**
- Import `QuartzConfig` and built-in plugins from Quartz's internal paths.
- Import this plugin by its npm package name.
- Add it to the `transformers` array along with other transformers.
- Order typically does not matter unless there are dependencies between plugins.

### Using in Markdown Files

#### MML Notation

````markdown
```mml
t120 l4 cdefgab<c
```
````

#### Chord Progression Notation

````markdown
```chord
C Dm7 G7 C
```
````

#### ABC Notation (Direct Specification)

````markdown
```abc
X:1
T:Simple Scale
M:4/4
L:1/4
K:C
C D E F|G A B c|
```
````

Useful for troubleshooting or when you want to write ABC Notation directly.

## Options

The plugin accepts optional configurations:

```typescript
MMLABCTransformer({
  enableMML: true,    // Enable MML block conversion (default: true)
  enableChord: true,  // Enable chord progression block conversion (default: true)
  enableABC: true,    // Enable ABC block conversion (default: true)
})
```

## How it Works

1. The plugin detects code blocks with `mml`, `chord`, or `abc` language tags during the Quartz build process.
2. It replaces these code blocks with HTML `div` elements containing the source notation as a data attribute.
3. In the browser:
   - Loads abcjs and mml2abc from CDN.
   - For MML blocks: Converts MML to ABC Notation using mml2abc.
   - For Chord Progression blocks: Converts chord progressions to MML using chord2mml, then to ABC Notation.
   - For ABC blocks: Uses the notation directly without conversion.
   - Renders the ABC Notation as an interactive SVG using abcjs.
   - Initializes an audio synthesizer to support music playback.
   - Adds click event handlers to allow playing music by clicking on the score.

## Notes

- Conversion to HTML happens during Quartz's build process.
- The actual score conversion and rendering occur in the browser.
- CDN library versions are specified based on verified operation with easychord2mml by @cat2151.
- MML to ABC conversion uses mml2abc loaded from a CDN.
- Chord progression to MML conversion uses chord2mml loaded from a CDN.
- Rendering uses abcjs (latest version 6.x) loaded from a CDN.
- Libraries are loaded dynamically to avoid bundling issues.

## Testing

The plugin includes a comprehensive automated test suite:

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests once
npm test

# Run integration tests (Playwright)
npm run test:integration

# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite includes:
- Unit tests for AST transformation logic (Vitest).
- Tests for HTML escaping (newlines, tabs, special characters).
- Tests for plugin options and configurations.
- Edge case handling.
- External resource validation.
- Integration tests for browser rendering and interactive features (Playwright).

For manual testing, please use the included `demo.html` file.

**Note**: When a Coding Agent runs tests on a Linux Runner, CDN access may be blocked, preventing the display of sheet music. If you wish to verify the sheet music display, please test on a physical machine (local environment).

## Reasons for Adopting the External Package Approach

This plugin adopts an external npm package distribution model rather than being integrated directly into the Quartz core. This design decision is based on the following reasons:

1. **Reusability**
   - The same plugin can be used across multiple Quartz projects.
   - No need to copy code into each project.

2. **Independence**
   - Allows for its own release cycle and version management.
   - Can be developed and updated independently of Quartz core updates.

3. **Shareability**
   - Easily shareable with the community via GitHub.
   - Increases accessibility for more users as an open-source project.

This approach maximizes the plugin's value and caters to a broader user base.
