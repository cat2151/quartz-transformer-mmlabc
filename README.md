## Status
- Core implementation is complete.
- Currently undergoing dogfooding.
- Destructive changes may occur.

## In 2 lines
- In Obsidian, you can write chord progressions in code blocks to display and play musical staff notation: https://github.com/cat2151/obsidian-plugin-mmlabc
- A new transformer plugin has been created to achieve the same functionality in Quartz4.

## Features

- 🎵 Converts `mml` code blocks to ABC notation and renders them with abcjs.
- 🎸 Converts `chord` code blocks to MML, then to ABC notation, and renders them with abcjs.
- 🎼 Supports `abc` notation code blocks for troubleshooting.
- 🎨 Displays musical staff notation as SVG.
- 🎧 Click-to-play music - click the rendered score to play the music.
- ⌨️ Keyboard accessibility support (play with Enter or Space key).

## Installation

Execute the following in your Quartz installation directory:

```powershell
npm install github:cat2151/quartz-transformer-mmlabc; pushd node_modules/quartz-transformer-mmlabc; npm run build; popd
```

Why this step is necessary:
- The plugin is installed directly from GitHub (not from npm).
- The `dist` directory containing compiled JavaScript is not included in the repository.
- Skipping this step will cause an error when running Quartz because the plugin's entry point (`dist/index.js`) will not exist.

Additionally, add the following before `Build Quartz` in `.github\workflows\deploy.yml`:
```yml
      - name: Build quartz-transformer-mmlabc
        run: npm run build
        working-directory: node_modules/quartz-transformer-mmlabc
```
Why this step is necessary:
- When deploying with GitHub Actions, without this, the plugin's entry point (`dist/index.js`) will not exist, causing an error during `Build Quartz`.

### Reason for adopting the external package method

This plugin is distributed as an external npm package, rather than being built into the Quartz core. This design decision is based on the following reasons:

1.  **Reusability**
    - The same plugin can be used across multiple Quartz projects.
    - Eliminates the need to copy code into each project.

2.  **Independence**
    - The plugin can have its own release cycle and version management.
    - Development and updates can proceed without being affected by Quartz core updates.

3.  **Shareability**
    - Easily shared with the community via GitHub.
    - Promotes broader adoption as an open-source project.

This approach maximizes the plugin's value and caters to a wider user base.

## Usage

### Usage in Quartz configuration

Add the transformer to `quartz.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { QuartzConfig } from "./quartz/cfg"
import * as Plugin from "./quartz/plugins"
import { MMLABCTransformer } from "quartz-transformer-mmlabc"

const config: QuartzConfig = {
  configuration: {
    // ... site settings
  },
  plugins: {
    transformers: [
      Plugin.FrontMatter(),
      Plugin.CreatedModifiedDate({ priority: ["frontmatter", "filesystem"] }),
      // Add MMLABC transformer
      MMLABCTransformer(),
      // ... other transformers
    ],
    filters: [Plugin.RemoveDrafts()],
    emitters: [
      Plugin.AliasRedirects(),
      Plugin.ComponentResources(),
      Plugin.ContentPage(),
      // ... other emitters
    ],
  },
}

export default config
```

**Important points:**
- Import `QuartzConfig` and built-in plugins from Quartz's internal paths.
- Import this plugin by its npm package name.
- Add it to the `transformers` array along with other transformers.
- The order is usually not an issue unless there are dependencies between plugins.

### Usage in Markdown files

#### MML Notation

````markdown
```mml
t120 l4 cdefgab>c
```
````

#### Chord Progression Notation

````markdown
```chord
C Dm7 G7 C
```
````

#### ABC Notation (Direct Specification)

````markdown
```abc
X:1
T:Simple Scale
M:4/4
L:1/4
K:C
C D E F|G A B c|
```
````

This is useful for troubleshooting or when you want to write ABC notation directly.

## Options

The plugin accepts optional settings:

```typescript
MMLABCTransformer({
  enableMML: true,    // Enable MML block conversion (default: true)
  enableChord: true,  // Enable chord progression block conversion (default: true)
  enableABC: true,    // Enable ABC block conversion (default: true)
})
```

## How it works

1.  The plugin detects code blocks with `mml`, `chord`, or `abc` language tags during the Quartz build process.
2.  It replaces these code blocks with HTML div elements containing the source notation as data attributes.
3.  In the browser:
    - abcjs and mml2abc are loaded from a CDN.
    - For MML blocks: mml2abc is used to convert MML to ABC notation.
    - For chord progression blocks: chord2mml is used to convert chord progressions to MML, then to ABC notation.
    - For ABC blocks: The notation is used directly without conversion.
    - abcjs is used to render the ABC notation as an interactive SVG.
    - An audio synthesizer is initialized to support music playback.
    - Click event handlers are added to allow playing music by clicking on the score.

## Current Status

### Implemented Features
- ✅ Detection and conversion of MML blocks.
- ✅ Detection and conversion of chord progression blocks.
- ✅ Detection and direct rendering of ABC blocks (useful for troubleshooting).
- ✅ Rendering of ABC notation using abcjs (display of musical staff).
- ✅ CDN dependencies use versions verified to work by @cat2151.
- ✅ Quartz dark mode compatibility (supports automatic theme detection and theme switching).
- ✅ Accessibility support (ARIA attributes, keyboard operation support).
- ✅ Interactive audio playback feature (click on the score to play the music from the beginning).
  - Uses abcjs synth API and Web Audio API.
  - Visual feedback during playback (background color change and status display).
  - Automatic stop upon playback completion.
  - Click again to stop playback.

## Notes

- Conversion to HTML occurs during the Quartz build process.
- Actual score conversion and rendering occur in the browser.
- CDN library versions are specified based on verification by @cat2151 with easychord2mml.
- MML to ABC conversion uses mml2abc loaded from a CDN.
- Chord progression to MML conversion uses chord2mml loaded from a CDN.
- Rendering uses abcjs (latest version 6.x.x) loaded from a CDN.
- Libraries are loaded dynamically to avoid bundling issues.

## Testing

The plugin includes a comprehensive automated test suite:

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests once
npm test

# Run integration tests (Playwright)
npm run test:integration

# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite includes:
- Unit tests for AST transformation logic (Vitest).
- HTML escaping tests (newlines, tabs, special characters).
- Plugin options and configuration tests.
- Edge case handling.
- External resource validation.
- Integration tests for browser rendering and interactive features (Playwright).

For manual testing, please use the bundled `demo.html` file.

**Note**: When the Coding Agent performs tests on a Linux Runner, CDN blocking prevents the display of staff notation. If you want to check the display of staff notation, please test on a physical machine (local environment).

## Dependencies

### Runtime (loaded via CDN)
