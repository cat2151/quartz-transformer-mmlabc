# quartz-transformer-mmlabc

A Quartz transformer plugin that converts Music Macro Language (MML) and chord progression notation code blocks into interactive sheet music using abcjs.

*This document is temporary and was hastily generated by an LLM. It will be revised in the future.*

## Features

- 🎵 Converts `mml` code blocks to ABC notation and renders them with abcjs.
- 🎸 Converts `chord` code blocks to MML, then to ABC notation, and renders them with abcjs.
- 🎼 Supports `abc` notation code blocks for troubleshooting or direct use.
- 🎨 Automatically renders sheet music as SVG (displays staff).
- 🎧 Play music on click - Clicking the rendered sheet music plays the music.
- ⚡ Lightweight, standalone npm module.
- 🔧 TypeScript support.

## Installation

Since this package is not published on npm, please install it directly from GitHub:

```bash
npm install github:cat2151/quartz-transformer-mmlabc
```

Or if you use yarn:

```bash
yarn add github:cat2151/quartz-transformer-mmlabc
```

## Build

**⚠️ Important:** After installation, you need to build the plugin to generate the `dist` directory:

```bash
cd node_modules/quartz-transformer-mmlabc
npm run build
```

Why this step is necessary:
- The plugin is installed directly from GitHub (not from npm).
- The `dist` directory containing compiled JavaScript is not included in the repository.
- The build process compiles the TypeScript source files into the necessary JavaScript files.

Skipping this step will cause an error when Quartz runs because the plugin's entry point (`dist/index.js`) will not exist.

## Usage

### Using in Quartz Configuration

Add the transformer to `quartz.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { QuartzConfig } from "./quartz/cfg"
import * as Plugin from "./quartz/plugins"
import { MMLABCTransformer } from "quartz-transformer-mmlabc"

const config: QuartzConfig = {
  configuration: {
    // ... site configuration
  },
  plugins: {
    transformers: [
      Plugin.FrontMatter(),
      Plugin.CreatedModifiedDate({ priority: ["frontmatter", "filesystem"] }),
      // Add MMLABC transformer
      MMLABCTransformer(),
      // ... other transformers
    ],
    filters: [Plugin.RemoveDrafts()],
    emitters: [
      Plugin.AliasRedirects(),
      Plugin.ComponentResources(),
      Plugin.ContentPage(),
      // ... other emitters
    ],
  },
}

export default config
```

**Key points:**
- Import `QuartzConfig` and built-in plugins from Quartz's internal paths.
- This plugin is imported by its npm package name.
- Add it to the `transformers` array along with other transformers.
- The order is usually not an issue unless there are dependencies between plugins.

### Using in Markdown Files

#### MML Notation

````markdown
```mml
t120 l4 cdefgab>c
```
````

#### Chord Progression Notation

````markdown
```chord
C Dm7 G7 C
```
````

#### ABC Notation (Direct Specification)

````markdown
```abc
X:1
T:Simple Scale
M:4/4
L:1/4
K:C
C D E F|G A B c|
```
````

This is useful for troubleshooting or when you want to write ABC notation directly.

## Options

The plugin accepts optional settings:

```typescript
MMLABCTransformer({
  enableMML: true,    // Enable MML block conversion (default: true)
  enableChord: true,  // Enable chord progression block conversion (default: true)
  enableABC: true,    // Enable ABC block conversion (default: true)
})
```

## How it Works

1.  During Quartz's build process, the plugin detects code blocks with `mml`, `chord`, or `abc` language tags.
2.  These code blocks are replaced with HTML `div` elements containing the source notation as a data attribute.
3.  In the browser:
    -   Load abcjs and mml2abc from CDN.
    -   For MML blocks: Convert MML to ABC notation using mml2abc.
    -   For chord progression blocks: Convert chord progressions to MML using chord2mml, then to ABC notation.
    -   For ABC blocks: Use the notation directly without conversion.
    -   Render ABC notation as an interactive SVG using abcjs.
    -   Initialize an audio synthesizer to support music playback.
    -   Add click event handlers to allow playing music by clicking the sheet music.

## Current Status

### Implemented Features
- ✅ MML block detection and conversion
- ✅ Chord progression block detection and conversion
- ✅ ABC block detection and direct rendering (useful for troubleshooting)
- ✅ ABC notation rendering using abcjs (displays staff)
- ✅ CDN dependencies use versions verified by @cat2151.
- ✅ Interactive audio playback feature (click the sheet music to play the piece from the beginning)
  - Uses abcjs synth API and Web Audio API.
  - Visual feedback during playback (background color change and status display).
  - Automatic stop on playback completion.
  - Clicking again stops playback.

## Notes

- Conversion to HTML occurs during Quartz's build process.
- Actual sheet music conversion and rendering occur in the browser.
- CDN library versions are **strongly specified** based on verification by @cat2151 with easychord2mml.
- MML to ABC conversion uses mml2abc loaded from CDN.
- Chord progression to MML conversion uses chord2mml loaded from CDN.
- Rendering uses abcjs (latest version 6 series) loaded from CDN.
- Libraries are loaded dynamically to avoid bundling issues.

## Testing

The plugin includes a comprehensive automated test suite using Vitest:

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests in UI
npm run test:ui
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite includes:
- Unit tests for AST transformation logic
- HTML escaping tests (newlines, tabs, special characters)
- Plugin option and configuration tests
- Edge case handling
- External resource validation

For manual testing, please use the included `demo.html` file.

**Note**: When a Coding Agent performs tests on a Linux Runner, the CDN may be blocked, preventing the display of sheet music. If you want to confirm the display of sheet music, please test on a physical machine (local environment).
