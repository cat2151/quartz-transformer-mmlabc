## Status
- Implementation is complete.
- Currently dogfooding.
- Subject to breaking changes.

## Features

- 🎵 Converts `mml` code blocks to ABC notation and renders them with abcjs.
- 🎸 Converts `chord` code blocks to MML, then to ABC notation, and renders them with abcjs.
- 🎼 Supports `abc` notation code blocks for troubleshooting or direct use.
- 🎨 Automatically renders musical scores as SVG (displays musical staff).
- 🎧 Click to play music - Click the rendered score to play the music.
- ⌨️ Keyboard accessibility support (play with Enter or Space key).
- 🌙 Automatic support for Quartz dark mode.
- ⚡ Lightweight, standalone npm module.
- 🔧 TypeScript support.

## Installation

Execute the following in your Quartz installation directory:

```powershell
npm install github:cat2151/quartz-transformer-mmlabc; pushd node_modules/quartz-transformer-mmlabc; npm run build; popd
```

Reason for this step:
- The plugin is installed directly from GitHub (not from npm).
- The `dist` directory, which contains the compiled JavaScript, is not included in the repository.
- Skipping this step will cause an error when Quartz runs because the plugin's entry point (`dist/index.js`) will not exist.

Additionally, add the following before `Build Quartz` in `.github\workflows\deploy.yml`:
```yml
      - name: Build quartz-transformer-mmlabc
        run: npm run build
        working-directory: node_modules/quartz-transformer-mmlabc
```
Reason for this step:
- During deployment with GitHub Actions, without this step, the plugin's entry point (`dist/index.js`) will not exist, causing an error during `Build Quartz`.

## Usage

### Using in Quartz Configuration

Add the transformer to `quartz.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { QuartzConfig } from "./quartz/cfg"
import * as Plugin from "./quartz/plugins"
import { MMLABCTransformer } from "quartz-transformer-mmlabc"

const config: QuartzConfig = {
  configuration: {
    // ... site configuration
  },
  plugins: {
    transformers: [
      Plugin.FrontMatter(),
      Plugin.CreatedModifiedDate({ priority: ["frontmatter", "filesystem"] }),
      // Add MMLABC transformer
      MMLABCTransformer(),
      // ... other transformers
    ],
    filters: [Plugin.RemoveDrafts()],
    emitters: [
      Plugin.AliasRedirects(),
      Plugin.ComponentResources(),
      Plugin.ContentPage(),
      // ... other emitters
    ],
  },
}

export default config
```

**Key points:**
- Import `QuartzConfig` and built-in plugins from Quartz's internal paths.
- Import this plugin by its npm package name.
- Add it to the `transformers` array along with other transformers.
- The order usually doesn't matter unless there are dependencies between plugins.

### Using in Markdown Files

#### MML Notation

````markdown
```mml
t120 l4 cdefgab>c
```
````

#### Chord Progression Notation

````markdown
```chord
C Dm7 G7 C
```
````

#### ABC Notation (Direct Specification)

````markdown
```abc
X:1
T:Simple Scale
M:4/4
L:1/4
K:C
C D E F|G A B c|
```
````

This is useful for troubleshooting or when you want to write ABC notation directly.

## Options

The plugin accepts optional settings:

```typescript
MMLABCTransformer({
  enableMML: true,    // Enable MML block conversion (default: true)
  enableChord: true,  // Enable chord progression block conversion (default: true)
  enableABC: true,    // Enable ABC block conversion (default: true)
})
```

## How It Works

1.  During Quartz's build process, the plugin detects code blocks with `mml`, `chord`, or `abc` language tags.
2.  It replaces these code blocks with HTML div elements containing the source notation as a data attribute.
3.  In the browser:
    -   abcjs and mml2abc are loaded from CDNs.
    -   For MML blocks: mml2abc is used to convert MML to ABC notation.
    -   For chord progression blocks: chord2mml is used to convert chord progressions to MML, then to ABC notation.
    -   For ABC blocks: The notation is used directly without conversion.
    -   abcjs is used to render the ABC notation as an interactive SVG.
    -   An audio synthesizer is initialized to support music playback.
    -   Click event handlers are added to allow playing music by clicking the score.

## Current State

### Implemented Features
- ✅ MML block detection and conversion
- ✅ Chord progression block detection and conversion
- ✅ ABC block detection and direct rendering (useful for troubleshooting)
- ✅ ABC notation rendering using abcjs (displays musical staff)
- ✅ CDN dependencies use versions confirmed working by @cat2151
- ✅ Quartz dark mode support (automatic theme detection and switching)
- ✅ Accessibility support (ARIA attributes, keyboard operation support)
- ✅ Interactive audio playback (clicking the score plays the music from the beginning)
  - Uses abcjs synth API and Web Audio API
  - Visual feedback during playback (background color change and status display)
  - Automatic stop upon playback completion
  - Clicking again stops playback

## Notes

- Conversion to HTML occurs during Quartz's build process.
- Actual score conversion and rendering occur in the browser.
- CDN library versions are specified based on working versions confirmed by @cat2151 with [easychord2mml](https://github.com/cat2151/easychord2mml/blob/main/index.html).
- MML to ABC conversion uses mml2abc loaded from a CDN.
- Chord progression to MML conversion uses chord2mml loaded from a CDN.
- Rendering uses abcjs (latest version 6.x.x) loaded from a CDN.
- Libraries are loaded dynamically to avoid bundling issues.

## Testing

The plugin includes a comprehensive automated test suite:

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests once
npm test

# Run integration tests (Playwright)
npm run test:integration

# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite includes:
- Unit tests for AST transformation logic (Vitest)
- HTML escaping tests (newlines, tabs, special characters)
- Plugin options and configuration tests
- Edge case handling
- External resource validation
- Integration tests for browser rendering and interactive features (Playwright)

For manual testing, please use the bundled `demo.html` file.

**Note**: When the Coding Agent performs tests on a Linux Runner, the CDN is blocked, so the musical staff will not be displayed. If you want to confirm the display of the musical staff, please test on a physical machine (local environment).

## Dependencies

### Runtime (Loaded via CDN)

**Important**: The following library versions are specified based on working versions confirmed by @cat2151 with [easychord2mml](https://github.com/cat2151/easychord2mml/blob/main/index.html). Do not change these URLs.

  - CDN: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/abcjs@6/dist/abcjs-basic-min.min.js`
  - Specifying `@6` always retrieves the latest version 6.x.x.
- [mml2abc](https://github.com/cat2151/mml2abc) - Converts Music Macro Language to ABC notation
  - CDN: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cat2151/mml2abc/dist/mml2abc.mjs`
  - Loaded via dynamic ES module import.
- [chord2mml](https://github.com/cat2151/chord2mml) - Converts chord progression notation to MML
  - CDN: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cat2151/chord2mml/dist/chord2mml.js`
  - Loaded as a UMD bundle.
  - Ensures security using SRI (Subresource Integrity) checksum.
  - Checksum: `sha384-s0MWjnJMkG/kT19h1SE4UrQ7YZ0eSnBKYgzstrrpAsrHer1g6ZqgCJJbmj0zTIcz`
  - *Checksum re-verification is required when the library is updated.*
