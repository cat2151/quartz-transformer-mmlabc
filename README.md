# quartz-transformer-mmlabc

A Quartz transformer plugin that converts MML (Music Macro Language) and chord progression notation code blocks into interactive sheet music using abcjs.

※This document is a temporary draft, hastily generated by an LLM. It will be revised in the future.

## Features

- 🎵 Converts `mml` code blocks to ABC notation and renders them with abcjs
- 🎸 Converts `chord` code blocks to MML, then to ABC notation, and renders them with abcjs
- 🎼 Supports `abc` notation code blocks for troubleshooting or direct use
- 🎨 Automatically renders sheet music as SVG (displays musical staff)
- 🎧 Click to play music - You can play music by clicking on the rendered sheet music
- ⚡ Lightweight and standalone npm module
- 🔧 TypeScript support

## Installation

This package is not published to npm, so please install it directly from GitHub:

```bash
npm install github:cat2151/quartz-transformer-mmlabc
```

Or if you use yarn:

```bash
yarn add github:cat2151/quartz-transformer-mmlabc
```

## Usage

### Using in Quartz Configuration

Add the transformer to `quartz.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { QuartzConfig } from "./quartz/cfg"
import * as Plugin from "./quartz/plugins"
import { MMLABCTransformer } from "quartz-transformer-mmlabc"

const config: QuartzConfig = {
  configuration: {
    // ... site configuration
  },
  plugins: {
    transformers: [
      Plugin.FrontMatter(),
      Plugin.CreatedModifiedDate({ priority: ["frontmatter", "filesystem"] }),
      // Add MMLABC Transformer
      MMLABCTransformer(),
      // ... other transformers
    ],
    filters: [Plugin.RemoveDrafts()],
    emitters: [
      Plugin.AliasRedirects(),
      Plugin.ComponentResources(),
      Plugin.ContentPage(),
      // ... other emitters
    ],
  },
}

export default config
```

**Important Points:**
- Import `QuartzConfig` and built-in plugins from Quartz's internal paths
- Import this plugin by its npm package name
- Add it to the `transformers` array along with other transformers
- The order is generally not an issue unless there are dependencies between plugins

### Using in Markdown Files

#### MML Notation

````markdown
```mml
t120 l4 cdefgab>c
```
````

#### Chord Progression Notation

````markdown
```chord
C Dm7 G7 C
```
````

#### ABC Notation (Direct Specification)

````markdown
```abc
X:1
T:Simple Scale
M:4/4
L:1/4
K:C
C D E F|G A B c|
```
````

This is useful for troubleshooting or when you want to write ABC notation directly.

## Options

The plugin accepts optional settings:

```typescript
MMLABCTransformer({
  enableMML: true,    // Enable MML block conversion (default: true)
  enableChord: true,  // Enable chord progression block conversion (default: true)
  enableABC: true,    // Enable ABC block conversion (default: true)
})
```

## How It Works

1.  The plugin detects code blocks with `mml`, `chord`, or `abc` language tags during the Quartz build process.
2.  These code blocks are replaced with HTML div elements containing the source notation as a data attribute.
3.  In the browser:
    - abcjs and mml2abc are loaded from a CDN.
    - For MML blocks: mml2abc is used to convert MML to ABC notation.
    - For chord progression blocks: chord2mml is used to convert chord progression to MML, then to ABC notation.
    - For ABC blocks: The notation is used directly without conversion.
    - abcjs is used to render the ABC notation as an interactive SVG.
    - An audio synthesizer is initialized to support music playback.
    - Click event handlers are added to allow playing music by clicking on the sheet music.

## Current Status

### Implemented Features
- ✅ Detection and conversion of MML blocks
- ✅ Detection and conversion of chord progression blocks
- ✅ Detection and direct rendering of ABC blocks (useful for troubleshooting)
- ✅ Rendering of ABC notation using abcjs (displays musical staff)
- ✅ CDN dependencies fixed to specific commit hashes
- ✅ Interactive audio playback feature (play the tune from the beginning by clicking the sheet music)
  - Uses abcjs synth API and Web Audio API
  - Visual feedback during playback (background color change and status display)
  - Automatic stop upon playback completion
  - Clicking again stops playback

## Notes

- Conversion to HTML occurs during Quartz's build process.
- Actual sheet music conversion and rendering happen in the browser.
- MML to ABC conversion uses mml2abc loaded from a CDN (fixed to commit `c32f3f3`).
- Rendering uses abcjs loaded from a CDN.
- Libraries are loaded dynamically to avoid bundling issues.

## Testing

The plugin includes a comprehensive automated test suite using Vitest:

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests in UI
npm run test:ui
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite includes:
- Unit tests for AST transformation logic
- HTML escaping tests (newlines, tabs, special characters)
- Plugin options and configuration tests
- Handling edge cases
- External resource validation

For manual testing, please use the included `demo.html` file.

**Note**: When the Coding Agent performs tests on a Linux Runner, the musical staff will not be displayed due to CDN blocking. If you wish to confirm the display of the musical staff, please test on a physical machine (local environment).
